"Team vs Independent Work
As a member of an engineering team, your responsibility is to carry out your part of the process independently and to the best of your ability. Consultation with other team members and research into best practices are all part of the engineering process. However, as an engineer, your professional responsibility is to give full and proper attribution to all material that comprises the work you perform. Plagiarism of any form is simply unacceptable and can lead to severe penalties such as the loss of oneâ€™s professional license. As a student, violations will be subject to the appropriate penalties as outlined in the Student Code of Conduct (see note below).

McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/ for more information)."
